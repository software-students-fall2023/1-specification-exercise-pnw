## Stakeholders

Interviewed: Brian Fraynd, Roberto Aguilar (Both NYU students).

Goals/Needs:

  -Find a place to eat, study, etc. at NYU.
  
  -Be able to find a quiet place to a study.
  
  -Be able to find a dining hall that doesn't have such a long wait.
  
  -Be able to identify such places in a quick, easy, and straightforward manner.

Problems/Frustrations:
  -In need of a quiet place to take an online class, or have a call or interview, but can't find an available space in time.
  
  -Need to eat, but there is only a short time to do so before the next class.
  
  -No way to know whether a given dining hall/study space is too crowded at a given point in time (without physically going there).
  
  -It's a waste of time to have to go looking around for an available study space, or to have to go to a dining hall only to find that there's a line that's too long, especially when you're in a hurry.
  

## Product Vision Statement

An app that will quickly and easily help identify available places to study and/or eat at NYU.

## User Requirements

1) As a user, I want to be able to quickly look at how many people there are currently at an NYU dining hall or study space, so I can quickly decide where to go.
2) As a user, I want to be able to add dining halls or study spaces to a list of Favorite spaces, so I can access the places where I want to go easily.
3) As a user, I want to see how many people are at a space I Favorited on the home screen, so I can easily access the places I visit frequently. 
4) As a user, I want to see past records of how busy individual study spaces were the week before, so I can choose the convenient times to visit.
5) As a user, I want to be able to search for a space with their name, so I can quickly locate the place I want to visit.
6) As a user, I want to know to not go to a space if it is too crowded currently, so I can plan my visits more effectively.
7) As a user, I want to see an associated image next to a listed NYU Dining hall or study space, so I can easily recognize the location.
8) As a user, I want a mobile application that works on both IOS and Android platforms, so I can access the app regardless of the device I'm using.
9) As a user, I want to receive notifications when a favorite dining hall or study space becomes less crowded, so I can choose the right time to visit.
10) As a user, I want to have the option to filter dining halls and study spaces based on specific criteria such as location, type (e.g., quiet study area, cafeteria), and current occupancy level, so I can find the most suitable place for my needs.
11) As a user, I want to submit feedback or comments about a specific dining hall or study space, such as noise level and crowdedness, so I can provide suggestion to improve the user experience.
12) As a user, I want to see the current occupancy level of a specific dining hall or study space when I click on it, so I can make real-time decisions about where to go.
13) As a user, I want the app to provide estimated wait times for popular dining halls during peak hours, so I can plan my meals more efficiently.
14) As a user, I want the app to suggest alternative dining halls or study spaces when my preferred choice is overcrowded, so I can find a suitable backup option.
15) As a user, I want the mobile application to have an intuitive and user-friendly interface, so I can easily navigate and use its features without confusion.
